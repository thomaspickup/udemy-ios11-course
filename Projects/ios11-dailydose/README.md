# Daily Dose

Daily Dose was a mock content application that would teach us the fundamentals of In-App-Purchases. Other than this it had no additional function. 
We utilised the Google AdMob framework to display an advert, to get rid of the advert we used an In-App-Purchase. This IAP could also be imported again in the case of moving the device or deletion of the app.
