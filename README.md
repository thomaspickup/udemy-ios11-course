# iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional
The **iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginner to Paid Professional** course is run by an amazing group of instructors called Devslopes. I found this course through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios11/) but you can also get it from their [website](https://devslopes.com/). 

It teaches the fundimentals and then some of iOS development using the Swift programming language. It also teaches how to use API's from Flickr's to a custom built one from Devslopes themselves. 

Below I have listed my progress and links to all the course repositories, as well as some Screenshots from the various apps. I have also noted what the app was teaching as well as any imported frameworks that are used (or API's).

## :basketball: Swoosh
Swoosh is an app designed to help us to start with learning the basics of the iOS design language. It is a simple app which uses segues to traverse between a mock sign up page. 
As well as this it teaches us how to pass data between different views.

This is the first app you design in the course and touches on features such as creating stacks of objects and adding constraints to different views. We also created custom Views for the buttons, which added a basic outline around the outside of it. As well as the custom View, we also created a custom Model which would hold the Player data (if we continued on into a proper app).

## :shirt: Coder Swag
Coder Swag is a mock store front designed to teach us the fundamentals of Table Views and Collection Views. In this app we created a reusable cell and learnt how to implement segues progragrammtically. 

It used also taught us the basics of how we can display data in an app, this time from a pre-coded service called DataService which served us Arrays of products. Alongside this, building the app also taught us how we would load in data to Cells, by creating custom views and having them handle the population of content.

## :money_with_wings: Window Shopper
Window Shopper is the first propper app that we could submit to the app store. It allows us to submit our hourly wage and an amount that an item would cost and work out how many hours we would have to work to buy it. 

It is the first app where we code logic into the app as well as focusing on the design. We have a custom button which snaps to the keyboard, as well as custom text fields with currency symbols which match the current locale. The app also demonstrates how we would run basic tests to make sure that our app logic is working as expected.

## :mega: Smack
The main feature of this Swift 4 Project is to demonstrate how Server <-> Client communications can work. It allows us to fetch data from a server and display it in the app as well as uploading messages and data back to that server and pushing it out to other users. 

The app itself allows the user to create an account and then create channels which themselves and other users can post into. Much like the real world application Slack. The user can browse through all the different channels that they have access to and post in any of them. The server side API is wrote by Devslopes and is deployed on a Heroku Instance.
